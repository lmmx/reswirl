# Product Requirement Document (PRD) for `igloosphinx`

> About: structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) for the `igloosphinx` Python library, detailing its objectives, key features, functional and non-functional requirements, development timeline, risks, success metrics, and roadmap. The PRD will focus on integrating Polars for high-performance data manipulation while ensuring compatibility with existing data product ecosystems. I will provide an organized document that aligns with your development standards and execution needs.

## 1. Project Overview
- **Objective**: Develop a Python library, `igloosphinx`, that efficiently retrieves and structures documentation inventories (`objects.inv`) for Python packages via PyPI metadata. The library will leverage Polars for high-performance DataFrame operations, ensuring seamless integration within a broader data product ecosystem.
- **Target Users**: Data scientists, software engineers, and technical writers who need structured access to package documentation.
- **Positioning within Ecosystem**: `igloosphinx` will complement existing data tools by providing structured and queryable documentation inventories, supporting both programmatic and CLI-based access.

## 2. Key Features & Requirements

### Core Features (Must-Have)
- Retrieve the `objects.inv` inventory URL using the `pypi-docs-url` tool or metadata.
- Parse the retrieved `objects.inv` into a Polars DataFrame containing key fields:
  - Symbol name
  - Symbol type (e.g., class, function, attribute)
  - Reference URL
  - Additional metadata extracted from the inventory
- Optionally retrieve full documentation for each symbol and append it to the DataFrame.
- Provide both a CLI interface and a Python library interface for these operations.
- Ensure idiomatic, efficient Polars usage (avoiding unnecessary Python loops or standard library workarounds).
- Implement clear error handling:
  - Raise meaningful errors for missing inventories or retrieval failures.
  - Ensure the CLI exits with proper status codes for pipeline-friendly behavior.

### Secondary Features (Nice-to-Have)
- **Caching**: Cache retrieved inventories locally to avoid redundant network requests on subsequent runs.
- **Extended Insights**: Offer additional analysis, such as inferring type hints or summarizing descriptions from the documentation text.
- **Configurability**: Allow configuration for package-specific quirks (e.g., alternate documentation hostnames or paths).

## 3. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **API Functionality**: Provide a function `get_inventory(package_name)` that:
  - Uses `pypi-docs-url` (or similar PyPI metadata inspection) to find the documentation base URL and specifically the `objects.inv` path.
  - Downloads and parses the `objects.inv` file into a Polars DataFrame with the specified columns.
  - If an option for full documentation retrieval is enabled, fetches the page or docstring for each symbol and includes it in the DataFrame.
- **CLI Tool**: Supply a command-line tool, `igloosphinx`, which accepts a package name and outputs the structured inventory. Support output formats like JSON, CSV, or a human-readable table.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure the library works on Python 3.9 and above. Manage dependencies via `pyproject.toml`, including Polars and any HTTP clients or the `pypi-docs-url` utility.
- **Polars Usage**: Leverage Polars DataFrame or LazyFrame appropriately for performance. Avoid converting to pandas or Python lists except when absolutely necessary. Be mindful of differences between `LazyFrame` and `DataFrame` for efficient transformations.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Retrieving and parsing a typical package’s inventory should be fast (target under 500ms for common packages on a decent network connection). DataFrame operations should be optimized using Polars vectorized methods.
- **Scalability**: Handle large documentation inventories (thousands of symbols) with minimal memory overhead. The solution should remain responsive and not degrade significantly with larger DataFrames.
- **Reliability**: The tool should handle network issues or missing inventory files gracefully, providing clear error messages rather than crashing.
- **Code Quality**: Code should be clean, well-documented, and idiomatic. Include docstrings and possibly type hints for maintainability. Ensure no significant warnings when running with future Polars versions to maintain forward compatibility.

## 4. Timeline and Milestones
- **Week 1-2**: Project setup and design. Define the API interface (`get_inventory`, CLI structure) and set up the Polars DataFrame integration. Prepare the development environment and continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
- **Week 3-4**: Implement `objects.inv` retrieval via PyPI metadata (`pypi-docs-url`) and basic parsing logic. Begin transforming parsed data into a Polars DataFrame structure.
- **Week 5-6**: Complete parsing of `objects.inv` into Polars DataFrame with all required fields. Develop the CLI tool for basic usage (package name in, structured list out). Integrate robust error handling for missing or unreachable documentation.
- **Week 7-8**: Performance tuning and optional features. Optimize Polars operations, add caching mechanism, and implement the optional full documentation retrieval into the DataFrame. Write unit tests covering core functionality.
- **Week 9-10**: Finalize documentation and testing. Create user documentation (README, usage examples), conduct end-to-end testing for various packages, and refine any UI/UX aspects of the CLI. Prepare for the first stable release (v1.0).

## 5. Risks, Constraints, and Dependencies
- **External Dependencies**: The tool relies on the `pypi-docs-url` utility or PyPI’s metadata. If a package has no documentation URL in its metadata or uses an unconventional documentation host, the tool must handle that gracefully (e.g., by notifying the user or attempting a sensible default).
- **Inventory Format Changes**: Sphinx’s `objects.inv` format is fairly stable, but any changes or version differences (e.g., Sphinx v2 vs v1 inventory) should be accounted for. Using a well-tested parser or library (or adhering strictly to the spec) can mitigate this risk.
- **Polars Versioning**: Polars is under active development. The implementation should avoid using very new or experimental APIs that might change. Pinning a Polars version or regularly updating the project to accommodate Polars updates might be necessary.
- **Environment Constraints**: The project targets Python 3.9+. Users on older Python versions or in restricted environments might not be able to use the library, but this is an acceptable trade-off given the focus on modern features.
- **Resource Constraints**: For extremely large documentation sets, memory or time could be a constraint. Mitigation includes lazy loading or chunked processing if needed, and clear messaging if an inventory is too large to handle without additional resources.

## 6. Success Metrics & Acceptance Criteria
- **Performance**: The tool should retrieve and parse a standard package’s inventory quickly (target under 500ms as a guideline for network + parse on average). Performance testing on popular packages (like NumPy or Pandas) will validate this.
- **Accuracy**: The DataFrame output must accurately reflect the `objects.inv` content. Each symbol in the inventory should appear with correct name, type, and URL. No symbols should be missing or incorrectly parsed.
- **Usability**: In CLI usage, providing a package name (and optional flags for format) should yield the expected output with no crashes. The CLI help should clearly explain usage. For the library, function calls should be intuitive and well-documented.
- **Adoption**: Although not a strict requirement for launch, a successful outcome would be community interest (e.g., 100+ GitHub stars and a few external contributors within 6 months). This would indicate the tool is filling a real need.
- **Stability**: The tool should run without major issues across different environments. Acceptance includes passing a battery of unit and integration tests, and no known severe bugs in the first release.

## 7. Roadmap & Future Extensions
- **Non-PyPI Support**: Extend the tool to support documentation that isn’t on PyPI or standard locations. For example, allow users to specify a direct documentation URL or support other package indexes.
- **Web UI**: Consider developing a lightweight web interface for browsing the structured documentation inventories. This could make it easier for non-programmers to explore package documentation in a structured way.
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Integrate deeper analysis of documentation, such as extracting type information, argument details, or even generating summary descriptions for each symbol using NLP. This could make the inventory more informative.
- **Integration**: Provide integrations or plugins for other tools (for example, a Jupyter notebook extension to fetch and display documentation info, or integration with Sphinx itself to validate documentation completeness).
- **Continuous Improvement**: Monitor user feedback and usage patterns to iteratively improve performance and usability. Ensure that as Polars and Sphinx evolve, `igloosphinx` stays up-to-date and relevant.

This PRD outlines the plan for `igloosphinx`, focusing on efficient documentation retrieval and structuring. It balances immediate must-have features with a vision for future enhancements, ensuring the project is both useful in the short term and adaptable in the long term.
